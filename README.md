## 💡 Inspiration

The startup journey is tough — not because people lack ideas, but because they struggle to structure, validate, and execute them. Traditional consulting is expensive and time-consuming, leaving many ideas unexplored.  
**IdeaMorph AI** was born to solve that — to democratize expert-level startup planning and make execution-ready blueprints accessible to *anyone* with an idea.
